      <h3>3.1: Introduction to Finance</h3>
      <p>Finance is a critical part of business management and impacts on all other functions of the business, including
        human resources, marketing, and operations.</p>
      <p>Organizations engage in <span id="id_capital_expenditure" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">capital expenditure
          </a></span>(which is the purpose of fixed assets) and <span id="id_revenue_expenditure" class="keyTerm"><a
            href="#">revenue expenditure
          </a></span>
        (which finances working capital and allows those fixed assets to generate productive opportunities).</p>
    </div>
    <div class=" infoCard" style="flex: 0 0 500px;">
      <h3>3.2: Sources of Finance</h3>
      <p>There are a range of internal and external sources of finfance available to an organization.</p>
      <p>Smaller organizations (such as sole traders) may be limited to <span id="id_personal_funds" class="keyTerm"><a
            href="#">personal funds
          </a></span>, <span id="id_retained_profits" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">retained profits
          </a></span> and the
        <span id="id_sale_of_shares" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">sale of personal shares
          </a></span>, or <span id="id_overdrafts_and_loans" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">loans, and overdrafts
          </a></span> from friends, family and
        financial institutions.
      </p>
      <p>As an organization grows, the range of external sources increases. Share capital becomes a potential
        source of
        finance. With increasing growth, an organization can borrow from financial institutions at lower
        interest rates.
      </p>
      <p> The growth of the internet has enabled <span id="id_crowdfunding" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">crowdfunding
          </a></span> for
        businesses that might struggle to secure
        finance from
        more traditional sources.</p>
      <p>The type of finance that an organization is looking for will depend on several factors, but central to
        this
        issue is the idea of matching. Short-term needs should be funded by short-term sources of finance.
        Longer-term
        needs should be funded by long-term sources of finance.</p>
      <p>There are a number of complex sale and lease-back schemes. They are used mostly for large fixed assets,
        or, increasingly, ICT systems. In <span id="id_leasing" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">lease
          </a></span> schemes, firms
        may be able to update assets periodically to avoid obsolescence. This has become a feature of new
        outsourced ICT schemes.</p>
      <p><span id="id_trade" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">capital expenditure
          </a></span> needs to be monitored carefully by an
        organization. The normal trade credit period is 30, 60, or even 90 days. Some organizations allow for
        discounts for prompt payments before the time limit is up.</p>
      <p>Venture capitalists are usually represented by groups and are arguably more aggressive in their
        dealings with providing finance. Venture capitalists may demand a greater say in decision-making. A <a href="#"
          class="keyterm" id="id_business_angels">business angel</a> is generally more hands-off.
        Increasingly, we are seeing business angels being attracted to financing more socially responsible or
        ethical business models.</p>
      <p>The work of Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank, who were pioneers in trying to help struggling
        entrepreneurs in developing countries finance some of their start-up capital, has lead to an increase in
        <span id="id_microfinance_providers" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">microfinance providers </a></span>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="infoCard" style="flex: 0 0 500px;">
      <h3>3.3: Costs and Revenues</h3>
      <p>Fixed or indirect <span id="id_costs" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">costs
          </a></span> must be paid even if the organization
        produces no output at all. These include insurance
        and electrical power. These costs are not related to the level of output and are also called "overhead costs".
      </p>
      <p>Variable or direct costs are related to the level of output produced. The higher the level of production, the
        higher the level of total variable or direct costs. Examples include raw materials used in the production of
        goods and services, and wages.</p>
      <p>Total <span id="id_revenue" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">revenue
          </a></span> is defined as the price of a unit sold to a
        customer multiplied by the number of units. The
        number of units sold is sometimes referred to as the sales volume.</p>
      <p>Ideally, organizations should not rely on just one product and thus one revenue stream. Increasingly,
        organizations are looking for ways to generate additional revenue streams. The film industry, for example, has
        had to look for ways to increase revenue other than sales of cinema tickets.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="infoCard" style="flex: 0 0 500px;">
      <h3>3.4: Final Accounts</h3>
      <p>Financial accounts have several purposes for <span id="id_stakeholder" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">stakeholders
          </a></span>
        and these purposes depend on the level of direct or
        indirect interest they have in an organization. Key stakeholders such as financial managers, the CEO, and
        shareholders will be looking at the final accounts to consider the financial performance of the organization.</p>
      <p>There are two versions of the <span id="id_pl" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">profit and loss accounts
          </a></span> account
        depending on whether the organization is a for-profit or
        not-for-profit entity.</p>
      <p>In addition to physical assets, an organization will also have several important intangible assets such as
        brand value and goodwill.</p>
      <p>Organizations must depreciate assets as they are used in the production process and/ or become obsolete.
        <span id="id_depreciation" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">Depreciation
          </a></span> is the way in which the cost of a fixed asset
        is spread over the useful life of the asset is spread
        over.
      </p>
      <p>There are two methods of depreciation to study as part of this course which are the <span id="id_straight"
          class="keyTerm"><a href="#">straight-line method
          </a></span> and the units of
        <span id="id_production" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">production method
          </a></span>(HL only).
      </p>
      <p>Once an organization has selected a method of depreciating assets, it should continue to use this so that the
        value of the fixed assets in its <span id="id_balance" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">balance sheet
            </a></span> is true and fair.
      </p>

    <div class="infoCard">
      <h3>3.5: Profitability and Liquidity Ratio Analysis</h3>
      <p> <span id="id_financial_ratios" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">Financial Ratios</a></span> are important for an organization to identify issues with their financial performance and
        position.</p>
      <p>If the financial ratio gives a poor result, strategies should be implemented to improve it.</p>
      <p>The interpretation of financial ratios needs to be weighed against external environments where the organization
        is operating.</p>
      <p>They highlight where an organization may need to address issues (i.e. low profitability, weak liquidity).</p>
      <p>These ratios need to be viewed in the context of external environments where they are calculated.</p>
      <p>
      <span id="id_profit_margin" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">Profit Margin</a></span>
      identifies the trade profits of a firm.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="infoCard">
      <h3>3.6: Efficiency Ratio Analysis</h3>
      <p> <span id="id_efficiency_ratios" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">Efficiency Ratios</a></span> measure the ability of an organization to use its assets and manage its liabilities
        effectively in the short term.</p>
      <p><span id="id_gearing" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">Gearing</a></span> is measured by observing how much of the firm's capital employed in the business is provided by long-term lenders.</p>
        <p>A single ratio in isolation without comparison to other firms or the external environment is not a basis for making a considered financial decision.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="infoCard" style="flex:0 0 500px;">
      <h3>3.7: Cash Flow</h3>
      <p>In short term, the economic sustainability of an organization will depend on how the 
        <span id="id_cashflow" class="keyTerm"> <a href="#">cash flow</a></span> is managed.</p>

      <p>Another way to view the difference between <span id="id_profit" class="keyTerm"><a href="#"> profit</a></span> and cash flow is that cash flow allows a business to purchase resources, transfer them into finished products, and deliver them to customers.</p>

      <p> <span id="id_cash" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">A cash flow forecast</a></span> can highlight a particular month where the
        organization may face a difficult
        <span id="id_liquidity" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">liquidity position</a></span>.
      </p>

    
    </div>

    <div class="infoCard" style="flex: 0 0 500px;">
      <h3>3.8: Investment Appraisal</h3>
      <p>Investment appraisal provides a good technique and insight into whether an organization should accept or reject
        a possible investment opportunity.</p>
      <p>There are various methods to help decide whether an investment opportunity should be taken: Payback, Average
        Rate of Return (ARR), and Net Present Value (NPV).</p>
      <p><span id="id_payback" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">Payback</a></span> is a straightforward way of looking at an investment
        opportunity. It assumes that expected returns are received evenly throughout the year.
      </p>
      <p>The <span id="id_average" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">average rate of return</a></span> sees whether the potential addition return is justified compared to the level of risk taken.</p>
      <p>However both payback and average rate of return lack a consideration of <span id="id_time" class="keyTerm"><a href="#"> the time value of money</a></span> the time value of money</a>.</p>
      <p>The <span id="id_present" class="keyTerm"><a href="#"> net present value</a></span> takes the time value of money into consideration, making it a more rigorous method.</p>
      
    </div>
    <div class="infoCard">
      <h3>3.9: Budgets</h3>
      <p><span id="id_profit_centres" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">Profit Centres</a></span> are allocated direct costs and revenues to calculate individual profit at that
        centre.</p>
      <p>Profit centres become accountable for their actions, which can lead to greater efficiency and productivity.</p>
      <p>A <span id="id_budget" class="keyTerm"><a href="#">budget</a></span> is a financial target or prediction of how much a firm is expected to spend or receive in a specific period of time.</p>
